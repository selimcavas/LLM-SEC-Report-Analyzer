With that, I will turn it over to Gary.  Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you for joining us today. In this third quarter, we saw a strong growth in procedures performed by our customers, solid new system placements, and healthy growth in utilization amid market conditions that remain largely consistent with Q2. Our new platforms continue to gain ground with eye on installs and procedure growth continuing, SP installs and procedure growth modestly accelerating, and healthy growth in customer use of our digital tools. Turning first to procedures. Da Vinci procedure growth in the quarter was 19%. Areas of strength included general surgery for benign conditions, particularly in the United States, and broad regional growth with Germany, Japan, the U.K., and India as standouts. China procedure growth was in line with our global average in the quarter. U.S. general surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and colon resection. Ion procedures showed continued strength with 125% growth in the quarter. SP procedure growth accelerated with 54% global growth in the quarter driven by strength in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 312 systems in Q3, compared with 305 systems in Q3 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands at 8,127 multi-port da Vinci systems, 490 Ion systems, and 158 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflect demand for additional capacity in multiport, continued greenfield interest in our Ion system, and a modest acceleration for placements of SP. The proportion of leases for new capital placements accelerated in the quarter with the U.S. using the highest leasing rates. We think the acceleration in leasing reflects the convenience of our leasing program and the maturity of our generation 4 multiport systems. While leasing reduces in-quarter revenue relative to capital purchase, total economics are healthy for our customers and for us. Leasing allows our customers to build clinical capacity when and where they need it and provides predefined pathways for our new technology as it enters the market. The growth rate in system utilization, defined as procedures per installed system per quarter, was 6%, down from 9% last quarter while still above historical growth rates. Strong procedure growth and an increased proportion of use in benign indications shortens average procedure times and eases scheduling. Higher utilization increases our customers' return on invested capital and is economically healthy for us. Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 12% in the quarter, and our operating expenses were within our spend guidance. Our spending reflects continued investments in research and development to support the growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints, and capital amortization. Looking at the broader picture. Our fourth-generation da Vinci platform is operating at global scale and embedded in a robust ecosystem of instruments, accessories, training, and services. Customer acceptance of our Ion platform is strong; acceptance of our da Vinci SP is accelerating with new indications in the pipeline; and our digital tools are building momentum through their early stages. We welcome Dr. Myriam Curet, Intuitive's chief medical officer, to this call, and she will take us through our clinical perspective and some of the work we're doing to expand indications. Our operations teams did a fantastic job supporting our customers through the supply chain shocks of the past several years. This unavoidable effort diverted resources away from product cost reduction, and as supply chain stresses ease, we're now pivoting our attention to once again lowering our product costs. Areas of opportunity include our Ion program, our SP accessories portfolio, and our multiport accessories and advanced instrument lines. Given the timing of facilities completion, manufacturing efficiency improvements for new products, and other complex projects, we expect variability in gross margin over the coming quarters as we work through these programs. Turning to our digital offerings. [inaudible] for digital tools and channels is growing nicely. Our SimNow surgical simulators are installed at the majority of our customer sites, and subscription renewal rates are outstanding. Routine use of My Intuitive app by over 10,000 da Vinci surgeons grew by 140% year over year and is receiving strong Net promoter scores that continue improving over time. Our Intuitive Hub media management and telepresence system installations grew 58% in the quarter, and the hub-captured surgical cases grew 61%. In closing, core demand is healthy. We're focused on extending our ecosystem internationally and driving our product costs down, particularly for our newer platforms. We are dogged in pursuit of significant long-term opportunity to improve the Quadruple Aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics, and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail. Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Core metrics continued to be healthy in Q3 with global procedure growth of 19%, an increase in the installed base of da Vinci systems of 13% and an increase in average system utilization of 6%. Our key financial indicators were also healthy. Third-quarter recurring revenue grew 21%; pro forma operating margin was 36%; and pro forma earnings per share increased 23% over last year. Procedures in the U.S. grew 17%, reflecting a lower benefit from patient backlogs as compared to the first half of 2023. Last quarter, we highlighted that our growth rate in bariatric procedures in the U.S. had slowed given patient interest in weight loss drugs. In Q3, we continue to see double-digit growth albeit at a modestly lower growth rate as compared to Q2. Bariatric procedures represent between 4% and 5% of total global procedures. Based on third-party data, we believe we continue to gain market share in the bariatric surgical segment. OUS procedures grew 24% with relative strength in India, Germany, the U.K., and Japan. Procedure growth in China was consistent with our expectations, lower than last quarter due to a strong base period given a recovery from COVID-related lockdowns in the year-ago quarter. Consistent with recent trends, growth in non-urology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 31%. Within the larger cancer categories, our fastest-growing OUS procedure is colon resection, a high-value procedure led by adoption in Japan, Germany, and the U.K. With respect to capital performance, we placed 312 systems in the third quarter, as compared to 305 systems last year. As a reminder, system placements in Q3 of last year benefited from a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered in June of last year. Late in Q3, we started to see delays in tender processes in China, primarily as a result of anti-corruption efforts by the central government, resulting in lower system placements in China in Q3. We expect tender delays to continue to impact system placements in China in Q4. Q3 revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year over year. Q3 revenue growth was driven by procedure growth, partially offset by an 11% decline in systems revenue due to the significant increase in the mix of operating lease arrangements. On a constant-currency basis, third-quarter revenue growth was also 12%. Given recent movements in exchange rates, at current rates, the U.S. dollar is approximately 3% stronger on a revenue-weighted basis as compared to the average rates realized in Q3. Revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represent approximately 24% of total revenue. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: In the U.S., we placed 159 systems in the third quarter, compared to 175 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 153 systems in Q3, compared with 130 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 60 into Europe, 32 into Japan, and 10 into China, compared with 54 into Europe, 32 into Japan, and 15 into China in Q3 of last year. Sixty-two of the 312 systems placed in Q3 were trade-in transactions, compared to 71 trade-in transactions in the third quarter of last year. As of the end of Q3, there are approximately 446 Sis remaining in the installed base, of which 85 are in the U.S. Operating leases represented 52% of third-quarter placements, compared with 37% last year. In the U.S., 70% of system placements in Q3 were under operating lease arrangements, compared to 48% last year. Of the 163 operating lease placements in the quarter, 93 were usage-based arrangements, an increase compared to 54 last year, reflecting customer preferences, particularly in the U.S. While leasing may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q3 system average selling prices were $1.4 million, as compared to $1.39 million last quarter and $1.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease in system ASPs was primarily driven by lower pricing and geographical mix. We recognize $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter, compared with $12 million last quarter and $17 million in Q3 of 2022. Da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure at approximately $1,830, compared with approximately $1,840 last quarter and $1,800 last year. On a sequential basis, lower I&A per procedure reflected the impact of customer ordering patterns, partially offset by a full-quarter impact from the I&A price increase that went into effect halfway through last quarter. Turning to our Ion platform. In Q3, we placed 55 Ion systems, as compared to 50 in Q3 of 2022. Third-quarter Ion procedures of approximately 14,500 increased 125% as compared to last year. Sixteen of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems, 12 into the U.S., and four into Korea. SP procedures grew by 54%, and average system utilization growth continued to accelerate, growing 21% compared to Q3 of last year. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter was 68.8%, compared with 68.5% last quarter and 69.8% last year. As a reminder, pro forma gross margin in Q3 of last year included a one-time benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. The remaining year-over-year difference in pro forma gross margin is primarily due to a higher mix of Ion revenue, which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system ASP, partially offset by the I&A price increase. Inventory increased to approximately 180 days in Q3, higher than historical averages driven by two factors. First, we have modestly increased our inventory targets given supply chain stresses over the last couple of years. And secondly, given significant capital investments we are making in manufacturing facilities and capacity, we are building bridge inventory to facilitate an elevated number of line transfers to new locations. As a result, we expect higher levels of inventory relative to historical norms into 2025. Third-quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 8% year over year, driven primarily by higher headcount-related costs. During the quarter, our headcount increased by 489 employees, of which approximately 275 were for our manufacturing operations in support of revenue growth. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were lower by 100 basis points as compared to Q3 of last year and largely reflected planned leverage in our enabling functions. Pro forma other income in Q3 was $58 million, compared to $42 million last quarter and $7 million last year. Other income primarily consists of interest income, and the increase as compared to last quarter was driven by higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances. Pro forma other income in Q3 of last year also reflected higher-than-typical foreign exchange losses resulting from remeasurement of the balance sheet as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $256 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increased manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. Third quarter pro forma net income was $524 million, or $1.46 per share, compared with $429 million, or $1.19 per share, for Q3 of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $416 million, or $1.16 per share, for the third quarter of 2023, compared with GAAP net income of $324 million, or $0.90 per share, for the third quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.5 billion, compared with $7.1 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities and proceeds from employee stock exercises, partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Myriam who will discuss clinical highlights. Myriam Curet -- Chief Medical Officer Thank you. Now, turning to the clinical side for our business. Each quarter, on these calls, we highlight certain studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extent of detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In addition to relaying the results of one of these studies, I'd like to start by describing the status of some important Intuitive research projects underway that support our company's belief in the potential value of da Vinci systems, specifically, our single-port system for procedures requiring refined access to tight or difficult-to-reach anatomical areas. In June 2021, Intuitive launched an FDA-approved clinical study focused on complex colorectal procedures, such as low anterior resection, or right colectomy, performed using the SP platform. Currently, enrollment is complete with 60 patients across nine sites in the U.S. and Korea. Another FDA-approved clinical trial of thoracic procedures, including pulmonary lobectomy and bilobectomy, performed using SP completed enrollment in June of this year with 32 subjects enrolled across six centers in the U.S. We believe that Intuitive's single-port technology will enable thoracic surgeons to perform uniportal lobectomy, something that may be difficult using a VATS approach. Intuitive intends to submit data from these two studies to the FDA after the patient follow-up outlined in the study plan and the data analysis has been completed. Now, I'll turn to a notable study published in the Annals of Surgery this past August. This study was not sponsored by Intuitive. Dr. Yogita Patel of McMaster University in Canada published early results from the RAVAL trial in a manuscript titled "Robotic Lobectomy is Cost-Effective and Provides Comparable Health Utility Scores to Video-Assisted Lobectomy." The study describes results from a multicenter, multinational, blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the da Vinci and VATS approach to pulmonary lobectomy. It analyzed 164 subjects, 81 in the robotic-assisted group and 82 in the VATS group, and all robotic-assisted lobectomies were performed with a da Vinci multiport platform. Notably, the health utility score was significantly higher in the da Vinci arm at seven weeks and 12 weeks post-procedure, which suggests the quality of life for patients who underwent a da Vinci lobectomy was better than for patients undergoing the VATS procedure. Interestingly and related to quality-of-life outcomes, the authors analyzed the incremental cost-effective ratio, or ICER, for the robotic group relative to VATS and reported the robotic group was associated with a gain of approximately $11,000 per quality-adjusted life year. In addition, the median number of lymph nodes examined and sampled were significantly higher in the da Vinci group. To summarize, the authors conclude that "Early results from the RAVAL trial suggest that robotic pulmonary lobectomy is a cost-effective intervention which is associated with comparable patient-reported health utility scores when compared to VATS lobectomy." And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss additional procedure highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2024. Brian King -- Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Myriam. Our overall third-quarter procedure growth was 19% year over year, compared to 20% for the third quarter of 2022 and 22% last quarter. In the U.S., third-quarter 2023 procedure growth was 17% year over year, compared to 18% for the third quarter of 2022 and 19% last quarter. Q3 growth was led by procedure strength within general surgery with particular strength in cholecystectomy and colon resection. Outside of the U.S., third-quarter procedure volume grew 24%, compared with 24% for the third quarter of 2022 and 28% last quarter. OUS growth was led by procedures beyond urology, which now make up approximately 50% of total OUS procedures. General surgery growth was strong, primarily in colorectal procedures, followed by growth in gynecology procedures. Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in Germany, the U.K., and Spain. In each of the regions noted, procedure growth was led by general surgery, primarily from colorectal procedures, and specifically in Germany and the U.K., hysterectomy procedures also contributed to strong growth. In Asia, growth was led by Japan. More than half of the incremental procedure growth in the country was led by strong growth in general surgery procedures, consisting largely of colorectal and gastrectomy procedures. In China, procedure growth was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Growth was driven primarily in urology, notably by prostatectomy and kidney procedures. In India, while in the early stage of adoption, saw strong growth in general surgery procedures, namely cholecystectomy and hernia repair, and growth in gynecology procedures. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full-year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 20% to 22%. We are now raising the low end from 20% to 21% and expect full-year 2023 procedure growth of 21% to 22%. The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients redetermining healthcare, a continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the U.S., and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending. At the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes, and bariatric growth rates in the U.S. continue at the rate we experienced in Q3. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2023 full-year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 68.5%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter to quarter, depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full-year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 14%. We are also refining our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between 600 million to 610 million in 2023, lowering the range from our previous estimate of 600 million to 620 million. We are increasing our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between 190 million and 200 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of 160 million and 180 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates. With regard to capital expenditures, we are narrowing our estimate to range between $900 million to $1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we are also refining our estimate for the 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 23% of pre-tax income, reducing the previous estimate of the upper end of the range from 24% to 23%. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Please stand by. We go to the first question from the line of Robbie Marcus, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Oh, great. Congrats on a good quarter. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to start, you know, it's hard to escape it, GLP-1 is becoming a very big topic in medtech, and you're -- it's impacting bariatric surgery here. It doesn't seem to be impacting anything else, particularly in the pipeline, but just wondering your thoughts overall. You know, could GLP-1 ultimately be a positive as more people try weight loss surgery and come in the funnel? And any other impacts, good or bad, that you foresee on the business? Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Oh, thanks, Robbie. I'm going to ask Dr. Curet as a bariatric surgeon to go ahead and weigh in on that first part of your question, and we'll talk about the broader implications after that. Myriam Curet -- Chief Medical Officer I think you are correct. I think, in the short term, we will see patients who are considering or are in the pipeline for bariatric surgery going to try the drugs. However, given compliance issues, costs, side effects, we expect that many of them will not stay on the drugs for longer than a year or two and, at that time, will consider bariatric surgery. So, I think, overall, we'll see an increased interest in bariatric surgery, but that will get delayed in the short term. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer And, Robbie, any -- any follow-up you wanted on GLP-1s? Robbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst No, I had a financial question for Jamie if that's OK, after. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer OK. Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer Please. Robbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Jamie, it looks like fourth-quarter gross margin is ticking down a bit, and you're talking about the increased depreciation cost and some of these new investments here. I was wondering if you could size the amount. And I'm really looking for how to think about into next year with depreciation, so we could get our gross margins set based on whatever expansion or contraction we're all forecasting. Thanks a lot. Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, for Q4, you're not really seeing significant depreciation expense reflected in the range that we provided. That's really more next year as some of the manufacturing capacity and facilities come online. What you're seeing in Q4 really is a little bit of FX, given how the rates have moved, a little bit of slower progress in some of the line transfers and product cost reduction plans that we have. That's not a large delay, it's just slightly slower than -- than we have planned. And then, there's some mix dynamics reflected in Q4. They net out to be relatively small, but those are the dynamics as to why that gross margin range for the year is, at the midpoint, slightly lower than what we had previously. With respect to how '24 is shaping up, what I would just say is, as Gary said in his prepared remarks, we'll see some variability in -- in gross margin over the next several quarters, is the depreciation expense and the ongoing efforts to improve our product costs, particularly on the Ion side. And frankly, there are some accumulated inefficiencies just in our global manufacturing operations. They built up over COVID and because of the supply chain issues that we encountered that we're addressing, and a number of those will take time for us to resolve. So, I'd say let us give a -- give you '24 guidance for gross margin when we get to January because I think we still have to work through those plans. Robbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks a lot. Operator We'll go to the next line. Travis Steed, Bank of America, please go ahead. Travis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yes, thanks for taking the question. I guess the follow-up on that, I know on the prepared remarks, it sounded like Gary said manufacturing improvements for new products and another complex projects. So, just curious if you could elaborate on -- on some of those new products and complex projects and what those are that's impacting the gross margin. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, on the product side, we have real work to do on Ion. Ion is well accepted by the customer base, growing quickly. We need to iterate and drive manufacturability and -- and manufacturing costs on Ion. So, that was the -- mainly what I was referring to. Some of the accessories and the SP line are real opportunities. We want to be assertive there. So, on the product side, that's -- that's most of what the reference is. Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer That -- just one of the element, we are insourcing high-volume accessory on the multiport side. And as part of insourcing that, there's some differential automation in the line there. And so, ramping that, you know, there's some work to get that to be at our targets. Travis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. Helpful. And coming into this year, on the procedures, you know, some of the swing factors were tied to staffing pressures and COVID. And I imagine like going into '24, you know, there's bariatric and China are some of the swing factors. Maybe just talk about some of the swing factors on -- on 2024 procedures, you know, pluses and minuses. And do you think China and bariatric are still going to be growing and, you know, adding to the growth and procedures in '24? Brian King -- Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations Travis, this is Brian. I guess, thinking of 2024, nothing really to share at this point. You know, clearly, I think when we get into January, we'll be able to give you a bit more insight, but I guess I'll just leave it at that for now. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer We -- just pick up two -- two topics you -- you hit, you know, on the China side, I think the procedure demand side remains robust. I think there's some government policy activity that's putting a little bit of a chill in the market. Some of that is economic. So, price caps and value-based pricing, and some of it is an anti-corruption probe that is giving -- giving hospitals some pause at moving forward with other new programs. We'll see. I think the China side is likely to see -- some pressure on the China side is likely to persist for several quarters. On the bariatric side, I think we'll find a new normal in the next few quarters. It's hard to predict exactly when that will happen. You know, we'll see that play out in the marketplace. Travis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. Thanks a lot. Operator And we'll go to the next line. Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, your usage-based leasing program has gotten some scale. Can you talk about the utilization rates on those systems relative to the average? And any other themes you could share? Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. I will turn to Jamie here on kind of utilization rates, so why don't you kick that off? Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, there's -- there's two ways to look at it, Larry: What is the absolute utilization rate compared to a regular leasing, compared to a purchase arrangement? They are very similar. Actually, the tightness on the mean between those three structures is -- is very tight. Within those arrangements, you generally have a target procedure level that reflects success of the program for the customer and the economic objectives that -- that we have. And if you accumulate again the portfolio, they run it slightly above the target of procedure levels that we have embedded in the contracts. So, they have -- they have run very well so far. And it's one of the reasons why we and the customer have expanded those so quickly in recent times. Larry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst That's helpful. And leasing in the U.S., you know, where do you see that going? I mean it was almost -- it was, you know, over 70 this quarter and last quarter. Have we plateaued, or does that continue to go higher? Thanks for taking the questions. Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer On -- on a global basis, we expect the proportion of placements that are leased to continue to climb. U.S. is pretty high, as you pointed out, Larry, 70% this quarter, 78% last quarter. There will be some larger IDNs that just routinely prefer to purchase just because of how that affects the metrics that are important to them. But even in the U.S., I think there's some room for that to continue to creep up a little bit. Obviously, running out of room. We found a number of U.S. customers have really appreciate that as a way to manage through what are tightly managed capital budgets. Larry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Thank you. Operator And next, we have Brandon Vazquez, William Blair. Please go ahead. Brandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. My first one, I wanted to talk a little bit about general surgery. That's obviously been a nice growth path for you here in the U.S. My understanding is it's a little -- a little less penetrated in international. What do you think needs to happen in the international markets to kind of get on that steep part of the adoption curve for general surgery as well? Are they kind of same timelines and catalysts to the U.S? Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Sure, thank you for the question. On -- one way to think about it is that general surgery comprises both procedures that are done where cancer is the underlying cause and others that are benign indication. On the cancer as an underlying cause, we're seeing nice early growth in several OUS markets, so there, I think that's healthy and we're enthused. I think reimbursements are generally in place in many of the places that we are operating. I think that's looked good, and clinical data coming out has been supportive. I think that, as you think about benign indications, we're seeing some of the beginnings of benign indications in some markets, there may be reimbursement work or education of insurers. That has to be done for those to progress further. So, in that setting, we'll – we'll have additional work to do as it plays out. Brandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst Great. And then, maybe last one for me as a follow-up. I think last quarter, you guys were talking a little bit about launching, I believe, it was called Case Insights, kind of a software AI platform. Any kind of updates on that end? How are things going so far, and maybe what's in the future for that program? Thanks. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you for the reference. So, Case Insights is our machine learning AI program that looks at surgical science. We have our first installs and first cases going. We had talked about it with you last quarter. So far, early feedback, and it's super early, we're really in the early innings here, is very good. Case Insights builds on some prior research that we had done with academic centers on something that we had described as a computational observer. So, we have some pretty good scientific underpinnings for it. We expect, over time, that that program will feed insights into different parts of the hospital's analytics system, from giving specific guidance to learning surgeons and care teams about where they might improve their technique and skills to giving suggestions to programmatics about efficiency and total cost management, to giving other insights for the company about how to improve procedures in the OR. So, we think it's -- it's a long-term set of investments around really the science of surgery. We remain extremely excited about it. While we do have some revenue for it, we don't expect it to be a serious revenue driver. We think it is ecosystem complementer, and we look forward to describing it more to you as time goes on. Brandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks a lot. Operator We'll go next to Matt Miksic, Barclays. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst Hey, thanks so much for taking the questions. So, I had one question on -- follow-up on kind of the bariatric trends and one on -- on sort of the system leasing effect on pricing. So, bariatric, if you could maybe talk about -- you mentioned the global percentage of -- of procedures that bariatric represents, maybe just the growth trajectory of that business in the second quarter and the third quarter and, you know, whether that's something you expect to grow at a similar trajectory or bottom out given your comments on folks getting on the drug for -- getting off, say, a year or two kind of suggests maybe a longer path to stabilization in that business line within. And then -- and then, I'll just follow up briefly with a question on ASPs if I could. Thank you. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Jamie, you might speak to kind of what the -- the size or percentage of that business is for us and a little bit of the acceleration or deceleration trend. Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, and I want to make sure I got it right, Matt. So, come back to me if I -- if I have the wrong questions, but our total bariatric business represents about 4% to 5% of global procedures. What you saw in Q2 was in the U.S., which is where the majority of our bariatric procedure volumes are, in the U.S. The growth rate declined to about the U.S. average. And then, what we saw in Q3 was it modestly declined a little further in Q3. Were those your questions? Matt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst Yeah, that's -- that's very helpful. And then, I guess just your expectation you framed out in terms of your guidance, but I mean is this -- I mentioned it just because one of the other competitors actually saw a decline, I guess, in laparoscopic, bariatric, or some combination of lap and open in the third quarter, single-digit decline. But you didn't seem like you're in that zone, right? You're still at or slightly below your average growth rate in the U.S. Is that -- am I hearing your answer correctly? Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer Well, if you take our procedure growth in bariatrics relative to market, we're taking share and have been for some time. So, the fact that we had double-digit growth in Q3 relative to another company that had a decline, that's just a reflection, in part, of the fact that we are taking share in bariatrics and continue to do so even though there's an impact overall bariatric surgery because of GLP-1s. Matt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it. That's very helpful. And then, the other, just on ASP, I understand the system ASP, you -- you -- you give is not -- does not -- as your U.S. leasing goes up, as I understand that, you know, those -- those leased systems in the U.S. are not included in that ASP calculation. So, you could maybe just speak to, I don't know, the way in which the increased leases have affected ASP or whether this is, you know, straight up year-over-year decline that's suggested in the sort of the overall numbers that you provide if I'm -- if that's a clear question? Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer So, everything you described is -- is correct. Generally -- although there can be exceptions for mix effects, generally, U.S. system ASPs, when purchased, are accretive to the global average. So, in effect, as leasing has grown significantly in the U.S., that, in and of itself, has an adverse effect for calculated system ASP. The other thing that you see then with now a greater proportion of systems used to calculate that system ASP being international, FX can -- can have an effect if you look on a two-year horizon. So, for example, the exchange rate in Japan based on how the U.S. dollar is strengthened, there's a 30 to 40% impact over a two-year basis on -- on system ASP in Japan, as translated. So, there is a geographical effect, and if you look at a long enough horizon, there's an FX effect. And what we described in Q3 was in terms of the year-over-year decline in ASP, also a dynamic relative to pricing. And that's really just as we expand our existing customers who are looking for third, fourth, fifth system, those tend to be slightly lower ASPs than you've seen previously when they were greenfield accounts. I would say that, in China, we do see some competitive dynamics with respect to pricing, just given the number of lower -- local players. And so, there's been some competitive effect on system ASPs in China specifically. We don't really see that in other markets to this point. Matt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst Thanks so much for the color. Operator And we'll go to the next line. Jayson Bedford, Raymond James, please go ahead. Jayson Bedford -- Raymond James -- Analyst Hi, good afternoon. Gary, I think you've expressed your -- your views on the role of bariatric surgery in a GLP world. I'm just wondering if these views have changed in any way over the last quarter or two. I know it's -- it's not a lot of time, but the adoption of this class of drugs is obviously ramping quickly. And then, just as kind of a related follow-up, getting back to Robbie's question on the potential impact of GLPs beyond bariatrics, do you expect an impact on some of your other procedure categories as GLPs get adopted? Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer OK, on the -- on the first one, I think Myriam described it well. Our position on GLP-1s, as it relates to bariatric surgery, I think -- I think she hit it well at the start of the call; no reason to reiterate it here. On the issue of potential impact beyond bariatrics, there may be some, although I think -- as you think through the analysis, I think it will be modest. And here's -- here's how we think about it. If you look at obesity and diabetes as risk factors in other domains and other -- and other diseases for which surgery is performed, they are sometimes positive correlated risk factors for that disease. In some weird cases, they're negative in cases that it's actually protective against disease. So, it's not entirely obvious. In most of the diseases that we treat, as we look at it, it is not the dominant risk factor. So, as we look out and think about what could it be like in our TAM, we can kind of do a back-of-the-envelope analysis. It is really early. I don't think anybody knows the exact number. What I can say is that it's not the dominant risk factor in most things that we look at. And we have a very large unpenetrated TAM. I think we're still in the early innings of what we're trying to work on. So, if -- if these drugs are highly effective at avoiding other types of diseases, we will cheer. I still think we have a lot of upside opportunity to pursue. Jayson Bedford -- Raymond James -- Analyst Fair enough. Thank you. Operator And we'll go to the next line. Ryan Zimmerman, BTIG, please go ahead. Ryan Zimmerman -- BTIG -- Analyst Thanks for taking the questions. I think you spoke about some of the new indications in SP. And if I'm not mistaken, I think there's a 30-day follow-up on the thoracic trial. But I'm curious if you could expand maybe when, you know, complex colorectal and thoracic cases potentially could become growth drivers for SP adoption and when you expect those -- not just those trials to wrap up but -- but potentially clearances in the U.S. with that. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Myriam, I think you're best to answer. Myriam Curet -- Chief Medical Officer Yes, so we are hoping to submit everything in the foreseeable future. After that, as you know, there's at least a 90-day turnaround for the IDE, and then -- excuse me, for the clearances. And then, after that, you know, we will have to put training together and the launches together. So, I can't really give you a timeline for when that would be, but we know what the work is that needs to be done, and we are starting and moving forward on that. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Our biggest -- Ryan Zimmerman -- BTIG -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Fair enough. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Our biggest step -- sorry, get the data arranged, get it into FDA, and work with them to get the clearances. And then, as -- as Myriam says, we'll go through a staged commercialization. So, you can expect submissions in the first half of '24 and then response thereafter. Ryan Zimmerman -- BTIG -- Analyst Thank you, Gary. One of the other things in this, I don't know if this is directed at you, Gary or Jamie, but you did talk about an opportunity to lower product costs as supply chain stresses ease. And I know there was -- you know, there were some comments earlier about your '24 gross margins. But -- but stepping aside from that, can you quantify the opportunity potentially for what that looks like? Have you gotten your arms around -- I know Marshall's been kind of shepherding these processes, but at what point can you give the Street more color on what that opportunity looks like to drive gross margin gains? Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer We have very well-detailed plans for each of the areas that we're focused on. The teams have the capability and skill. It's going to take some time. I think the best way I would answer the question is we see a path over time, probably in the midterm, to get back above 70% gross margin. Ryan Zimmerman -- BTIG -- Analyst Thank you, Jamie. Operator We'll go to the next line. Anthony Petrone, Mizuho Group, please go ahead. Anthony Petrone -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst Thanks. Maybe one on China and one on pricing on instruments, when we think about the quota size that the National Health Commission in China put out, the new quota's 559 systems, just wondering on anti-corruption, you know, could that shift that number over time, whether it be that just there's fewer capital dollars going to projects or, you know, just from a timing element because things are getting elongated? And then, the pricing question would be on instruments and accessories. The company put a 5% price increase in their first one in 14 years. Chairman Powell came out and said, you know, look, inflation is going to be persistent and elevated for quite some time. If inflation stays high, you know, could another 5% price increase be on the table for 2024? Thanks. Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer With regard to the capital side in China, I'll jump into that. I think demand for our systems and for the procedures they support in China, raw demand is really high. So, it's really being limited or titrated by policy. I don't see -- I haven't heard anything that says people want to go back and revisit or lower the -- the quota. I think the -- that that would be resisted by customers who are looking for -- for purchases. So, I think it's more around delay and -- and kind of a timing thing and how long that is hard to predict, but months, not -- not weeks. On the -- on the pricing side, I'll -- I'll speak to a general principle rather than projecting '24. You know, what we try to do is a couple of things. One is be an outstanding manufacturer, really get high quality at low cost and make sure that we can invest in manufacturing prowess to do that. I think that's really powerful for us. It gives us enormous flexibility to meet the customers' needs, kind of where they are. With regard to pricing, we look at a couple of things. Certainly, price to us, cost to us, but also price elasticity, what the customer can do and achieve, and that varies by market. And I think we've become increasingly sensitive to, and sophisticated at, understanding pricing. So, raw material pricing and core inflation to us is an input to our pricing, that's why we took price up this last year. But it's not the only thing, and you shouldn't expect us to be purely algorithmic tracking inflation on its own. Anthony Petrone -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst Thank you. Operator And we'll go to the line of Michael Polark of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Mike Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I have a big-picture one, modeling long term. There's an investor presentation out earlier this year. In it, Intuitive identified 6 million procedures globally for multi and single port, for which you currently have line of sight; and on that same slide, identified that there's 20 million soft tissue surgery procedures overall. And if -- if I look at where you are today, you're approaching 40% of that 6 million. And so, my question is the delta between the 20 and the six, the 14, kind of how do you expand the six toward the 20? And, you know, what are the major unlocks that you expect over the next three to five years that'll move the six toward the 20, and you know, kind of your feel for the pace of addressing more of the global procedure pie? Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, it's a good question. The -- I think the general tools that we use to get from six to 20 are kind of three buckets. Some of them are clearances in new markets, so making sure that that market we can address has access to the technologies that we already have. So, you think about something like Ion, for example. Ion is not yet available on all the markets in which we operate. As it operates, as it starts to open, what we can do, that's kind of one bucket. New indications are another one, that some of the work that Myriam described earlier, that -- that starts to open new opportunities for us as we broaden the applicability of our platforms to new types of surgery and intervention. The -- the third bucket or another bucket is reimbursement. There are places where we think additional data is required to get insurers to engage a little bit differently and open the market. And then, lastly, there are new products in technologies that we're working on that we have not yet described that we think allow us to -- to provide new solutions that are -- are competitive in the marketplace. Each of those operates on a little bit different timeline. So, it's not -- I can't give you a simple synopsis of how fast each one runs. Some of them take a lot of years. Some reimbursement things are long -- long-lead. Product development can be long lead. Other types of access can happen more quickly. But that's a set of plans that we lay out. We're pretty disciplined about laying out what we want to do over time over a multiyear time horizon, and -- and that's how we start to open that market. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians, and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadrupling--better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation and surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs, and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most.
